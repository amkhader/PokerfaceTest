1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,516
- Balancing chemical
equations is one of those

2
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:07,086
concepts in chemistry that
often confuses people.

3
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:11,623
But I think we'll see that
if we work through this

4
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:13,673
carefully and methodically,
and we also appreciate

5
00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:15,797
the art of balancing chemical equations,

6
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:18,120
that it's actually not too bad.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,722
So first of all, what
is a chemical equation?

8
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:22,670
Well this is a chemical
equation right over here.

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,776
It's describing a reaction.

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,788
So if I take an atom of
aluminum and I add it

11
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:32,070
to a dioxygen molecule, so a molecule that

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,457
has two oxygens with it, under
the appropriate conditions

13
00:00:36,457 --> 00:00:40,054
they will react to form aluminum oxide.

14
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:43,153
And the aluminum oxide molecule has

15
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:47,064
two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms.

16
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:48,600
And so you might say, "Okay, well what's

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,960
"the balancing business all about?

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,496
"I have a chemical reaction.

19
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:53,059
"What do I have to balance?"

20
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:55,341
Well if you look carefully,
you might notice that

21
00:00:55,341 --> 00:01:00,024
you don't have the same number
of each atom on both sides.

22
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:02,341
For example, right over
here on the left-hand side,

23
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:04,126
how many aluminums do we have?

24
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:06,901
Well on the left-hand
side, we have one aluminum.

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,150
How many do we have on
the right-hand side?

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,302
Well on the right-hand
side, we have two aluminums.

27
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:14,984
And so aluminum just can't
appear out of thin air

28
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:17,311
by virtue of some magical reaction.

29
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,075
You have to have the same amount
of aluminums on both sides,

30
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:22,498
and the same thing is
true for the oxygens.

31
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:26,399
Over here on the left-hand
side, we have two oxygens.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,138
They form one dioxygen molecule
that has two oxygen atoms.

33
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:33,779
And then over here in the
aluminum oxide molecule,

34
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:35,537
we have three.

35
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:38,485
We have three oxygen atoms.

36
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:41,207
So once again, we can't
just have miraculously

37
00:01:41,207 --> 00:01:44,837
an oxygen atom appear out of nowhere.

38
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:47,566
So we have to balance the number
of aluminums on both sides,

39
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,732
this number and this
number should be the same,

40
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,638
and we have to balance
the number of oxygens,

41
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:55,127
this number and that
number should be the same.

42
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:56,551
So how do we do that?

43
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,855
Well one thing might be
to say, "Okay, if I've got

44
00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:02,237
"two aluminums here and
I have one aluminum here,

45
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:03,963
"well why don't I just double the number

46
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:06,293
"of aluminums right over here?"

47
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,157
I could just write a two in front of it,

48
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:09,747
so now this has two aluminums,

49
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:11,592
so I no longer have one aluminum here.

50
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:14,102
I now have two aluminums,
and so it looks like

51
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:17,623
the aluminums are balanced,
and they are indeed balanced.

52
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:20,362
But still we have an
issue with the oxygens.

53
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:22,079
Over here I have two oxygens.

54
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,432
Over here I have three oxygens.

55
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:25,893
So one thing that you might say is,

56
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:27,894
"Okay, well how do I go from two to three?

57
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:30,111
"I could multiply by 1.5."

58
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:34,646
So I could multiply by 1.5,

59
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:37,335
and if I multiply 1.5 times two,

60
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:38,906
that's going to be three.

61
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:42,560
So now I have three
oxygen atoms on this side

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,218
and three oxygen atoms on this side.

63
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:47,413
But the convention is that we don't like

64
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:50,105
writing "1.5 molecules."

65
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:52,403
We don't like having this
notion of a half molecule,

66
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:54,329
which is kind of this bizarre notion.

67
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:56,868
We want whole number molecules.

68
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,900
So what can we do?

69
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:01,747
Well, you can imagine that
this makes it very similar

70
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:04,304
to what you did in algebra,
an algebraic equation.

71
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:08,343
We just can multiply both
sides by the same number

72
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:12,478
that gets rid of having this
fraction or this decimal here.

73
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,165
So if we multiplied both sides

74
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:15,991
by two, we're going to do that.

75
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:19,235
This is going to be a four,
this is going to be a three,

76
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:21,216
this is going to be a two right over here.

77
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:22,249
So let me do that.

78
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:25,138
Let me multiply both sides by two.

79
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,737
So instead of two aluminum atoms,

80
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:28,330
let me have four aluminum...

81
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,855
Actually, let me just write
the chemical equation first

82
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:32,346
in the form that it was before.

83
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:36,509
So I had aluminum plus dioxygen,

84
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,508
a molecule of two oxygens,
yielding in the reaction --

85
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:44,314
these are the reactants,
this is the product --

86
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:49,294
aluminum, aluminum, aluminum oxide.

87
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:51,992
So what I'm saying here
is to get rid of this 1.5,

88
00:03:51,992 --> 00:03:55,030
to turn it into a whole number,
let's multiply all of these,

89
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,810
all of the number of molecules by two.

90
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,772
And here, there's implicitly a one...

91
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:03,293
Let me do this in a different color.

92
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:06,379
There is implicitly a one right over here.

93
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,394
So let's multiply all of these by two.

94
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:10,680
So two times two is...

95
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,622
Let me do that same color.

96
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:16,362
Two times two is four...

97
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,500
That's not the same color.

98
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,346
Two times two is four.

99
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:25,117
1.5 times two is three.

100
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:27,316
And then one times two,

101
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:29,234
one times two is two.

102
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,141
And now you can verify how many aluminums

103
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:32,991
do we have on each side?

104
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,050
Well I have four aluminum
atoms on the left-hand side,

105
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,014
and how many do I have
on the right-hand side?

106
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:40,975
I have four aluminum atoms.

107
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:43,935
How many oxygens do I have
on the left-hand side?

108
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:48,382
I have three molecules of dioxygen.

109
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:50,622
Each molecule has two oxygen atoms,

110
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:53,656
so I have six oxygens on the left,

111
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:57,218
and I have two times three oxygens

112
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:58,908
on the right, or I have six oxygens.

113
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:02,108
So my chemical equation is now balanced.
