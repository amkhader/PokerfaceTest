1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,466
adenosine triphosphate, and
even when we look at its

2
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:05,601
molecular structure it seems
quite involved, but if we break

3
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:07,801
it down into its constituent
parts it becomes a little bit

4
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:11,733
more understandable and we'll
begin to appreciate why,

5
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:16,167
how it is a store of energy
in biological systems.

6
00:00:16,497 --> 00:00:19,067
The first part is to break
down this molecule between

7
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:20,933
the part that is adenosine
and the part that

8
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:24,533
is the triphosphates, or
the three phosphoryl groups.

9
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,497
The adenosine is this
part of the molecule,

10
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:30,334
let me do it in that same color.

11
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:34,133
This part right over here is adenosine,

12
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:37,400
and it's an adenine connected to a ribose

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,667
right over there, that's
the adenosine part.

14
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,000
And then you have three phosphoryl groups,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,333
and when they break off they
can turn into a phosphate.

16
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:53,667
The triphosphate part
you have, triphosphate,

17
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:58,934
you have one phosphoryl
group, two phosphoryl groups,

18
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:03,399
two phosphoryl groups and
three phosphoryl groups.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,133
One way that you can conceptualize
this molecule which will

20
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,399
make it a little bit easier
to understand how it's a store

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,533
of energy in biological systems
is to represent this whole

22
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,134
adenosine group, let's just
represent that as an A.

23
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:21,267
Actually let's make that an Ad.

24
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:23,066
Then let's just show it bonded to

25
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:25,467
the three phosphoryl groups.

26
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,497
I'll make those with a P
and a circle around it.

27
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:33,333
You can do it like that,
or sometimes you'll see it

28
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,267
actually depicted, instead
of just drawing these

29
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:38,267
straight horizontal lines
you'll see it depicted

30
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:40,932
with essentially higher energy bonds.

31
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:44,066
You'll see something like that to show

32
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:46,534
that these bonds have a lot of energy.

33
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:53,867
But I'll just do it this way
for the sake of this video.

34
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:56,667
These are high energy bonds.

35
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:58,000
What does that mean, what does that

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
mean that these are high energy bonds?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,267
It means that the electrons
in this bond are in a

38
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:07,867
high energy state, and if
somehow this bond could be

39
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:10,799
broken these electrons are
going to go into a more

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,001
comfortable state, into
a lower energy state.

41
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,667
As they go from a higher
energy state into a lower, more

42
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:20,333
comfortable energy state they
are going to release energy.
