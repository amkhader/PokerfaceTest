1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630


2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,800
What we have depicted right over
here is a combustion reaction.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,730
We have the hydrocarbon
methane right over here.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,470
You take that.

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,840
You take some molecular oxygen.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
You give them enough heat.

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,559
And then, they are
going to combust.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,880
And they're going to produce
carbon dioxide, water, and then

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,110
more energy than you put in.

10
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,800
This is an exothermic reaction.

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,270
More energy comes
out than you put in.

12
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,770
This is why fires
keep spreading.

13
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,304
This is why combustion
is used to power things.

14
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:32,720
But that's not what we're going
to focus on in this video.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,960
In this video, we want
to think about-- which

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,950
of these components, of
these molecules, what's

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,250
being oxidized and
what is being reduced?

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,930
And to do that,
let's first think

19
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,740
about the oxidation
states of the input atoms

20
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,970
and the oxidation
states of the outputs--

21
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,839
of the different constituents
of these molecules.

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,90
So I encourage you to
now pause this video

23
00:00:55,90 --> 00:00:59,280
and try to figure
that out on your own.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,190
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

25
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,50
Now, let's work
through this together.

26
00:01:04,50 --> 00:01:05,910
Let's first think
about the methane.

27
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,250
And I have a bunch of
electronegativities here based

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,540
on the Pauling scale
listed out here,

29
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,230
but let's just
visualize methane.

30
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,725
Methane is a carbon
bonded to 4 hydrogens.

31
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:17,610


32
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,730
In our oxidation state world--
even though, this, in reality,

33
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,980
is a covalent bond--
we pretend like they're

34
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,850
hypothetically ionic bonds.

35
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:30,70
So we have to give the electron
pair to one of the parties

36
00:01:30,70 --> 00:01:31,460
to the bond.

37
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,649
If we look between
carbon and hydrogen,

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,90
carbon is more
electronegative than hydrogen.

39
00:01:38,90 --> 00:01:41,260
So we will assume that carbon
will be hogging the electrons

40
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,10
and that hydrogen will be
giving away the electrons.

41
00:01:44,10 --> 00:01:46,370
So carbon's going to take--
in this hypothetical world--

42
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,440
hypothetically take an electron
from each of these hydrogens.

43
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,320
It is going to have an
oxidation state of negative 4,

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,369
an electron from
each of 4 hydrogens.

45
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,160
Negative 4.

46
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,590
And once again, we write
the sign after the number

47
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,289
probably so that we don't get
these confused with exponents.

48
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,830
Now, let's think
about the hydrogens.

49
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,880
Each of those
hydrogens is having--

50
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,260
in this hypothetical world--
an electron taken away from it.

51
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,280
We could say it has an
oxidation state of plus 1, which

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,976
we could write as 1 plus.

53
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:18,600
Or we could just
write a positive right

54
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,239
over here-- a plus sign.
