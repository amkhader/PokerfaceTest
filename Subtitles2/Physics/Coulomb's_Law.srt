1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,745
And it wasn't until
1785, and there were many

2
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:02,603
that came before Coulomb,

3
00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:06,255
but in 1785 Coulomb formally published

4
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:09,120
what is known as Coulomb's law.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,556
And the purpose of Coulomb's law,

6
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:13,375
Coulomb's law,

7
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:17,490
is to predict what is
going to be the force of

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,341
the electrostatic force
of attraction or repulsion

9
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,291
between two forces.

10
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,427
And so in Coulomb's law, what it states is

11
00:00:24,427 --> 00:00:25,937
is if I have two charges,

12
00:00:25,937 --> 00:00:28,460
so let me, let's say this
charge right over here,

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,427
and I'm gonna make it in white,

14
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:30,882
because it could be positive or negative,

15
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:34,133
but I'll just make it q
one, it has some charge.

16
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,803
And then I have in Coulombs.

17
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:39,729
and then another charge
q two right over here.

18
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,215
Another charge, q two.

19
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:44,487
And then I have the distance
between them being r.

20
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:47,892
So the distance between these two charges

21
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:50,333
is going to be r.

22
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:54,334
Coulomb's law states that the force,

23
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:55,889
that the magnitude of the force,

24
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,520
so it could be a repulsive force

25
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,534
or it could be an attractive force,

26
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:01,532
which would tell us the
direction of the force

27
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:03,134
between the two charges,

28
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:04,759
but the magnitude of the force,

29
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:07,476
which I'll just write it as F,

30
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:09,443
the magnitude of the electrostatic force,

31
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:10,842
I'll write this sub e here,

32
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:12,644
this subscript e for electrostatic.

33
00:01:12,644 --> 00:01:14,650
Coulomb stated, well this is going to be,

34
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,717
and he tested this, he didn't
just kind of guess this.

35
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:19,759
People actually were assuming
that it had something

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,752
to do with the products of the magnitude

37
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:26,325
of the charges and that as the particles

38
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:27,700
got further and further away

39
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,673
the electrostatic force dissipated.

40
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,437
But he was able to actually measure this

41
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:33,876
and feel really good
about stating this law.

42
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,337
Saying that the magnitude
of the electrostatic force

43
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:38,140
is proportional,

44
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,820
is proportional,

45
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,978
to the product of the
magnitudes of the charges.

46
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:47,552
So I could write this
as q one times q two,

47
00:01:47,552 --> 00:01:49,363
and I could take the
absolute value of each,

48
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:50,712
which is the same thing as just

49
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:52,583
taking the absolute value of the product.

50
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,354
Here's why I'm taking the
absolute value of the product,

51
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:55,934
well, if they're different charges,

52
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:57,140
this will be a negative number,

53
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:59,927
but we just want the overall
magnitude of the force.

54
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,437
So we could take, it's proportional to

55
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:04,650
the absolute value of the
product of the charges

56
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,234
and it's inversely proportional to

57
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:07,985
not just the distance between them,

58
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:12,187
not just to r, but to the
square of the distance.

59
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:14,904
The square of the distance between them.
