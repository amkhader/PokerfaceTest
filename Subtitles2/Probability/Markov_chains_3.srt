1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,051
This claim angered another
Russian mathematician,

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:06,928
Andrey Markov, who
maintained a very public

3
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:09,486
animosity towards Nekrasov.

4
00:00:09,486 --> 00:00:12,277
He goes on to say in a letter
that "this circumstance

5
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:15,287
"prompts me to explain
in a series of articles

6
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:18,775
"that the law of large numbers can apply

7
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:20,765
"to dependent variables,"

8
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,251
using a construction which he brags

9
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:25,982
Nekrasov cannot even dream about.

10
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:28,960
Markov extends Bernoulli's results

11
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:33,463
to dependent variables using
an ingenious construction.

12
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:36,313
Imagine a coin flip
which isn't independent,

13
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:40,061
but dependent on the previous outcome,

14
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:44,097
so it has short-term memory of one event.

15
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:46,506
This can be visualized
using a hypothetical

16
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,688
machine which contains two cups,

17
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:50,248
which we call states.

18
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:52,301
In one state we have a 50-50 mix

19
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:54,440
of light versus dark beads,

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,104
while in the other state we
have more dark versus light.

21
00:00:58,104 --> 00:01:00,282
One cup we can call state zero.

22
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:02,996
It represents a dark
having previously occurred,

23
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,895
and the other state, we can call one,

24
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:08,381
it represents a light bead
having previously occurred.

25
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:11,534
To run our machine, we simply
start in a random state

26
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:13,681
and make a selection.

27
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:16,326
Then we move to either state zero or one,

28
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,034
depending on that event.

29
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:19,767
Based on the outcome of that selection,

30
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,638
we output either a zero if it's dark,

31
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:23,611
or a one if it's light.

32
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:25,604
With this two-state machine,

33
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:28,145
we can identify four possible transitions.

34
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:30,356
If we are in state zero
and a black occurs,

35
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,465
we loop back to the same
state and select again.

36
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:35,304
If a light bead is selected, we jump over

37
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:38,356
to state one, which can
also loop back on itself,

38
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:42,190
or jump back to state
zero if a dark is chosen.

39
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,961
The probability of a light
versus dark selection

40
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:47,247
is clearly not independent here,

41
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:49,919
since it depends on the previous outcome.

42
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:52,422
But Markov proved that
as long as every state

43
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:55,351
in the machine is reachable, when you run

44
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:56,747
these machines in a sequence,

45
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:59,137
they reach equilibrium.

46
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:01,361
That is, no matter where you start,

47
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:02,456
once you begin the sequence,

48
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,379
the number of times you visit each state

49
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:10,432
converges to some specific
ratio, or a probability.

50
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:14,299
This simple example
disproved Nekrasov's claim

51
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:16,710
that only independent
events could converge

52
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:19,586
on predictable distributions.
