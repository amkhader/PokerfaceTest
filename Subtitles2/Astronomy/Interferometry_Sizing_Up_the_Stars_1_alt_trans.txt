It’s very difficult to wonder about

life, our lives, life on this planet,

and life on other planets, without first

wondering about stars. 

Stars are the substance, the engines that build

everything in our known universe.

And without understanding stars, we will

never understand where planets come from

and where we came from.

We have one star that we’ve been able to

study in exquisite detail, and that’s the Sun

and that’s because it’s so close by.

You can actually take pictures of it

and be able to see sunspots

and see solar explosions. And

the Sun is the only star that we’ve

been able to look at in this sort of detail.

And this is where you need special

techniques to look at other stars

and see them in the sort of detail that has

been previously only done for the Sun.

CHARA stands for Center for High

Angular Resolution Astronomy,

which basically is the theme of what we do.

Resolution is the ability to see fine detail

in distant objects, and unfortunately,

distances are so great in astronomy

that resolution has always been

something that has been unattainable

for most of the objects we look at.

Stars, for example, are so far away

that even with the biggest

telescopes that we've ever built

most of them appear just as points

of light. But the kind of problems

that we have to solve involving

measuring sizes of stars

requires us to build telescopes that

are not just tens of meters across,

but hundreds of meters across, and

those are completely unfeasible

for the indefinite future.

So we get around this problem by

synthesizing a single giant telescope

with arrays of smaller telescopes.
