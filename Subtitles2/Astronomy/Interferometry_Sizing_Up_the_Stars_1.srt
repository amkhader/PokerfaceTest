1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,880
It’s very difficult to wonder about

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,860
life, our lives, life on this planet,

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,299
and life on other planets, without first

4
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:12,738
wondering about stars. 

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,900
Stars are the substance, the engines that build

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,599
everything in our known universe.

7
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:21,60
And without understanding stars, we will

8
00:00:21,60 --> 00:00:22,790
never understand where planets come from

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,310
and where we came from.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,300
We have one star that we’ve been able to

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,739
study in exquisite detail, and that’s the
Sun

12
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,840
and that’s because it’s so close by.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,280
You can actually take pictures of it

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,640
and be able to see sunspots

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,680
and see solar explosions. And

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,610
the Sun is the only star that we’ve

17
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,960
been able to look at in this sort of detail.

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,530
And this is where you need special

19
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,570
techniques to look at other stars

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,70
and see them in the sort of detail that has

21
00:00:50,70 --> 00:00:54,730
been previously only done for the Sun.

22
00:01:03,60 --> 00:01:04,540
CHARA stands for Center for High

23
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:05,990
Angular Resolution Astronomy,

24
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,679
which basically is the theme of what we do.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,130
Resolution is the ability to see fine detail

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,199
in distant objects, and unfortunately,

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,630
distances are so great in astronomy

28
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,699
that resolution has always been

29
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,220
something that has been unattainable

30
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,130
for most of the objects we look at.

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,310
Stars, for example, are so far away

32
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,570
that even with the biggest

33
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,908
telescopes that we've ever built

34
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:29,190
most of them appear just as points

35
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,929
of light. But the kind of problems

36
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,930
that we have to solve involving

37
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,510
measuring sizes of stars

38
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,30
requires us to build telescopes that

39
00:01:38,30 --> 00:01:39,810
are not just tens of meters across,

40
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,760
but hundreds of meters across, and

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,530
those are completely unfeasible

42
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,840
for the indefinite future.

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,689
So we get around this problem by

44
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,789
synthesizing a single giant telescope

45
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,970
with arrays of smaller telescopes.
