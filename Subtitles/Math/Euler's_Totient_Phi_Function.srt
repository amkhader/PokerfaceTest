continued to investigate

2
00:00:03,594 --> 00:00:05,851
properties of numbers, specifically

3
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:08,839
the distribution of prime numbers.

4
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:11,2
One important function he defined

5
00:00:11,2 --> 00:00:12,843
is called the phi function.

6
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:15,818
It measures the breakability of a number.

7
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:17,899
So, given a number, say N,

8
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:21,546
it outputs how many integers
are less than or equal to N

9
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:24,892
that do not share any
common factor with N.

10
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:28,279
For example, if we want
to find the phi of eight

11
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,873
we look at all values from one to eight,

12
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:32,874
then we count how many integers

13
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:35,987
eight does not share a
factor greater than one with.

14
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:37,204
Notice six is not counted,

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,127
because it shares a factor of two,

16
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:41,946
while one, three, five
and seven are all counted,

17
00:00:41,946 --> 00:00:44,361
because they only share a factor of one.

18
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:48,106
Therefore, phi of eight equals four.

19
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,775
What's interesting is that calculating

20
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:54,249
the phi function is
hard, except in one case.

21
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:55,816
Look at this graph.

22
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:58,296
It is a plot of values of five,

23
00:00:58,296 --> 00:01:01,192
over integers from one to 1,000.

24
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:04,328
Now, notice any predictable pattern?

25
00:01:05,59 --> 00:01:07,913
The straight line of points along the top

26
00:01:07,913 --> 00:01:10,777
represent all the prime numbers.

27
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:14,441
Since prime numbers have no
factors greater than one,

28
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,778
the phi of any prime number, P,

29
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:20,264
is simply P minus one.

30
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,553
To calculate phi of seven, a prime number,

31
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:25,128
we count all integers, except seven,

32
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:27,465
since none of them share
a factor with seven.

33
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:30,338
Phi of seven equals six.

34
00:01:31,773 --> 00:01:36,773
So, if you're asked to find
phi of 21,377, a prime number,

35
00:01:37,837 --> 00:01:39,732
you would only need to subtract one

36
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:44,38
to get the solution, 21,376.

37
00:01:44,236 --> 00:01:47,798
Phi of any prime is easy to compute.

38
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,445
This leads to an interesting
result based on the fact

39
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:53,869
that the phi function
is also multiplicative.

40
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:58,869
That is, phi A times B
equals phi A times phi B.

41
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:04,685
If we know some number N is
the product of two primes,

42
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:08,92
P one and P two, then phi of N

43
00:02:08,92 --> 00:02:12,619
is just the value of phi for
each prime multiplied together,

44
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,620
or P one minus one, times P two minus one.
