00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870


2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,470
In the last video we defined
internal energy as literally

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,470
all the energy that's
in a system.

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,340
That's kind of the most
inclusive version,

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,190
at least in my head.

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,840
So that's my system, it's
some type of container.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,100
And I have a bunch of
particles in here.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,630
It's literally the sum of
the kinetic energies

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,820
of all these particles.

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,280
If they had potential
energies, we'd

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,240
throw that in there.

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,259
If they have electrical
potential, we'd

13
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,460
throw that in there.

14
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,680
If they have bonds with each
other, the energies in that

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,840
bond, we would throw
it in there.

16
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,710
It's everything.

17
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,540
It's all inclusive.

18
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,550
And, I told you in the last
video it's unintuitive that U

19
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,890
stands for internal energy.

20
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,720
But I kind of think that, you
know, U, it contains the

21
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,550
universe of energy.

22
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,980
You know, that's just for
me to memorize it.

23
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,339
Don't think too deeply into
what I just said.

24
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,830
But this is internal energy.

25
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,320
If you show me a system, it
has some internal energy.

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,890
It's a function of its state.

27
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,70
I don't care how it got to that
state, but if you told me

28
00:00:57,70 --> 00:00:59,580
a system at a certain state,
maybe with a certain pressure,

29
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,280
or a certain volume, or at a
certain temperature-- although

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,550
if you give me pressure and
volume that should be enough--

31
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,940
I can tell you what its
internal energy is.

32
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,840
Especially if you tell me the
type of molecule I have, and

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,930
things like that.

34
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,990
Now we also said in the last
video that because internal

35
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,640
energy is all the energy in
the system, it can't be

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,260
randomly created or destroyed.

37
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,50
It can just be transformed
from one form to another.

38
00:01:23,50 --> 00:01:28,600
So if I have a change in
internal energy, it can only

39
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,59
be due to-- well, it can be
due to more than what I'm

40
00:01:31,60 --> 00:01:31,620
describing.

41
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,220
But in our simple world where
all of the energy in a

42
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,520
system-- and maybe we're dealing
with gases, because

43
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,80
that's normally what you deal
with in a first-year chemistry

44
00:01:39,80 --> 00:01:42,289
course-- it's going to be the
heat that could be added to

45
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,860
the system, plus the work
done on the system.

46
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,820


47
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,830
And like I said in the last
video, sometimes they'll say,

48
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,260
instead of plus the work done
on the system, sometimes

49
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:57,20
they'll say, minus the work
that the system does.
