00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640


2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,564
Let's think a little bit about
the molecule sodium chloride.

3
00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:09,590
If we look at the periodic
table right over here,

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,930
we see that sodium
is a Group 1 element.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,340
It's an alkali metal.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,910
It has one valence electron.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,000
It's also not too
electronegative.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,764
It's sitting here on
the left-hand side

9
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:21,680
of the periodic table.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,360
We know the general trend
for electronegativity

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,650
is that it increases as
we go to the top right.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,390
So these elements
over here generally

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,990
like to hog electrons.

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,310
These elements
over here generally

15
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,250
like to give away electrons.

16
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,130
These are electropositive,
these are electronegative.

17
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,500
So sodium right over here,
with its one valence electron,

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,600
it's a very good candidate
for giving away an electron.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,980
On the other side of
the periodic table,

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,750
we have chlorine
right over here.

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,640
It's a Group 7 element.

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,550
It's a halogen.

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,690
It would love nothing more than
to gain an electron so that it

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,370
can get to the magic number
of eight valence electrons.

25
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,210
It is very electronegative.

26
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,350
So what you can
imagine would happen

27
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,399
is that if these two
things were to interact?

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,460
The chlorine would nab sodium's
extra electron over here,

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,89
and it would become
the chloride anion.

30
00:01:24,90 --> 00:01:27,860
And then sodium would
become the sodium cation.

31
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,440
Cation just is a positive ion.

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,890
Anion is just a negative ion.

33
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,850
And so this one right
over here is now positive.

34
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,559
Sodium is now positive.

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,985
Chloride is a negative ion.

36
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:42,110
And so they're going to be
attracted to each other,

37
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,990
and they're going to
form this ionic bond.
