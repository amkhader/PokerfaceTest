1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,329
So we know water is H2O.

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,000

3
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,470
Each water molecule is one
oxygen bonded to two hydrogens.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,680
And these two bonds
are covalent bonds.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,960
In each of these
bonds, you have a pair

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,680
of electrons that
are being shared

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,729
by both the hydrogen
and the oxygen.

8
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:19,880

9
00:02:25,70 --> 00:02:28,859
But we also know that this
isn't a completely equal sharing

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,660
of the electrons.

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,710
We look on the
periodic table here,

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,390
oxygen is far more
electronegative

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,410
than hydrogen is.

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,400
And so because of that, the
electrons in these two bonds

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,430
are going to spend
more time around oxygen

16
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,790
than they are going to
spend around the hydrogens.

17
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,970
And we've seen this before.

18
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,690
This would give the oxygen
end of the water molecule

19
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,620
a partially negative charge.

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,960
That's the lowercase
Greek letter delta.

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,680
We use that for the notation
of partially negative.

22
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,870
And on the hydrogen
ends of the molecule,

23
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,730
we're going to have a
partially positive charge.

24
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,310
Now, this is the reality.

25
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,480
But as we'll see later
on in future videos,

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,530
it's sometimes inconvenient to
have this partial messiness.

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,330
And so what I'm
going to do right now

28
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,320
is introduce you to
what is fundamentally

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,169
just an intellectual tool.

30
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,320
It's just a convention
that chemists

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,919
have invented that
allow us to get

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,670
our heads around
a lot of reactions

33
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,690
and allow us to think about how
is a reaction likely to occur.

34
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:29,080
And that intellectual tool is
the idea of oxidation states.

35
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,950

36
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,902
What the oxidation
state is, even if you're

37
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:40,289
in a situation where you
have covalent bond, you say,

38
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,040
well, look, I understand.

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,550
Those are partial charges.

40
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,740
These are covalent bonds.

41
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,120
The electrons are being shared.

42
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,480
But I don't like
this partial stuff.

43
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,100
I want to just assume
hypothetically,

44
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,329
what if these were ionic bonds?

45
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,520
And you say, well, if these
had to be ionic bonds,

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,060
then the oxygen would nab the
electrons from these pairs.

47
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:11,320
And so the oxygen would have
a fully negative charge,

48
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,019
a negative 2 charge.

49
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:21,380
And the hydrogens would have
a fully positive charge each.
