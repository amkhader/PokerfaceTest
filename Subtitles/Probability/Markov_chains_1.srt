00:00:03,787 --> 00:00:05,157
Voiceover: When observing
the natural world,

2
00:00:05,157 --> 00:00:08,118
many of us notice a somewhat
beautiful dichotomy.

3
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:12,594
No two things are ever exactly alike,

4
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:16,373
but they all seem to follow
some underlying form.

5
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:18,602
Plato believed that the true forms

6
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,355
of the universe were hidden from us.

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,285
Through observation of the natural world,

8
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:27,225
we could merely acquire
approximate knowledge of them.

9
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:30,235
They were hidden blueprints.

10
00:00:30,235 --> 00:00:32,369
The pure forms were only
accessible through abstract

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,239
reasoning of philosophy and mathematics.

12
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,717
For example, the circle he describes

13
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:39,855
as that which has the distance

14
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:43,931
from its circumference to
its center everywhere equal.

15
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:46,951
Yet we will never find
a material manifestation

16
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:51,79
of a perfect circle or a
perfectly straight line.

17
00:00:51,79 --> 00:00:52,820
Though interestingly, Plato speculated

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,563
that after an uncountable number of years,

19
00:00:55,563 --> 00:00:58,366
the universe will reach an ideal state,

20
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:01,667
returning to its perfect form.

21
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:05,82
This Platonic focus on abstract pure forms

22
00:01:05,81 --> 00:01:07,472
remained popular for centuries.

23
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:09,585
It wasn't until the 16th century

24
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:12,848
when people tried to embrace the messy

25
00:01:12,848 --> 00:01:14,964
variation in the real world

26
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:20,111
and apply mathematics to
tease out underlying patterns.

27
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:26,288
Bernoulli refined the idea of expectation.

28
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:28,997
He was focused on a method
of accurately estimating

29
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:32,526
the unknown probability
of some event based on

30
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:37,479
the number of times the event
occurs in independent trials.

31
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,432
He uses a simple example.

32
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,857
Suppose that without your knowledge,

33
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:45,411
3,000 light pebbles and 2,000 dark pebbles

34
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:48,347
are hidden in an urn,
and that to determine

35
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:51,887
the ratio of white versus
black by experiment,

36
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:54,378
you draw one pebble after another,

37
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:57,472
with replacement, and note how many times

38
00:01:57,472 --> 00:02:02,56
a white pebble is drawn versus black.

39
00:02:02,56 --> 00:02:04,335
He went on to prove
that the expected value

40
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:06,823
of white versus black observations

41
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:09,223
will converge on the actual ratio

42
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:12,322
as the number of trials increases,

43
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:15,709
known as the weak law of large numbers.
