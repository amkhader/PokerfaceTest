1
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:31,299
adenosine triphosphate, and
even when we look at its

2
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,434
molecular structure it seems
quite involved, but if we break

3
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,634
it down into its constituent
parts it becomes a little bit

4
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:40,566
more understandable and we'll
begin to appreciate why,

5
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:45,000
how it is a store of energy
in biological systems.

6
00:00:45,33 --> 00:00:47,900
The first part is to break
down this molecule between

7
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,766
the part that is adenosine
and the part that

8
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:53,366
is the triphosphates, or
the three phosphoryl groups.

9
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,33
The adenosine is this
part of the molecule,

10
00:00:57,33 --> 00:00:59,167
let me do it in that same color.

11
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:02,966
This part right over here is adenosine,

12
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:06,233
and it's an adenine connected to a ribose

13
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,500
right over there, that's
the adenosine part.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,833
And then you have three phosphoryl groups,

15
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:16,166
and when they break off they
can turn into a phosphate.

16
00:01:17,704 --> 00:01:22,500
The triphosphate part
you have, triphosphate,

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,767
you have one phosphoryl
group, two phosphoryl groups,

18
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:32,232
two phosphoryl groups and
three phosphoryl groups.

19
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:35,966
One way that you can conceptualize
this molecule which will

20
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:39,232
make it a little bit easier
to understand how it's a store

21
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:44,366
of energy in biological systems
is to represent this whole

22
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:47,967
adenosine group, let's just
represent that as an A.

23
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:50,100
Actually let's make that an Ad.

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,899
Then let's just show it bonded to

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,300
the three phosphoryl groups.

26
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:59,33
I'll make those with a P
and a circle around it.

27
00:01:59,33 --> 00:02:02,166
You can do it like that,
or sometimes you'll see it

28
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,100
actually depicted, instead
of just drawing these

29
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,100
straight horizontal lines
you'll see it depicted

30
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,765
with essentially higher energy bonds.

31
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:12,899
You'll see something like that to show

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,367
that these bonds have a lot of energy.

33
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:22,700
But I'll just do it this way
for the sake of this video.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,500
These are high energy bonds.

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,833
What does that mean, what does that

36
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,833
mean that these are high energy bonds?

37
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,100
It means that the electrons
in this bond are in a

38
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,700
high energy state, and if
somehow this bond could be

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,632
broken these electrons are
going to go into a more

40
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:42,834
comfortable state, into
a lower energy state.

41
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:45,500
As they go from a higher
energy state into a lower, more

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,166
comfortable energy state they
are going to release energy.
