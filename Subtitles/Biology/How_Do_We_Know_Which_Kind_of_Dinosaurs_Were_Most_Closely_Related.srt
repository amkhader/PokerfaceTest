1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,48
for us understand that the genealogy the
relationships among dinosaurs we use the

2
00:00:04,49 --> 00:00:05,580
same techniques and tools

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,650
as other biologists use to understand
how different groups of organisms are

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,160
related

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,170
the primary one that we use the
technique of cladistic

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,890
and park listed is is that we just look
at number about repeating the animal

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,80
and then we try to find the shortest
path

8
00:00:21,80 --> 00:00:24,750
through those attributes when I say
shortest path I mean the least

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,109
evolutionary steps

10
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,779
I mean for instance if we had you know
three animals in

11
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,570
the room with us now we had say we had a
human

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,950
say we had a a mouse I

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,59
and say we had with her right well one
of the attributes that links the mouse

14
00:00:41,59 --> 00:00:42,329
anti-human together

15
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,789
his hair so if you would say that the
mouth

16
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:49,399
in the wizard were most closely related
you would have to have to evolutionary

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,600
steps the independent or gin up hair

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,870
but by saying that hair only originate
once

19
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,879
it evidence for a preferential
relationship between

20
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,849
humans in mouth so that's a very simple
example but we do that with hundreds of

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,960
characters in hundreds a battle
sometimes

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,390
and then we have computer algorithms
which actually go through the matrix and

23
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,60
find the shortest path through it

24
00:01:09,60 --> 00:01:12,560
and results and a family tree up these
animals
