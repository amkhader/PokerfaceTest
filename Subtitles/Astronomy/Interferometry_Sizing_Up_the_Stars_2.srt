00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
The CHARA array is a collection of six

2
00:00:01,499 --> 00:00:04,260
telescopes that are arranged on the ground

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,600
in an area that more or less kind of

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,490
covers the area that a single large

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,489
telescope mirror would have. And what we

6
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:14,370
then have to do is to have relay optics—

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,409
many, many mirrors along

8
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:17,969
the way to effectively

9
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:19,809
move the beams as if the

10
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,990
telescopes were all placed

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,179
lying on this optical mirror

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,150
that we’re trying to synthesize.

13
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,510
And that’s been the real problem

14
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,189
with interferometry, being able to

15
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,349
precisely control the beams of light to

16
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,548
attain that synthesis of a single mirror.

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,360
This is part of the daily

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,400
alignment check. Essentially we

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,290
send a laser beam backwards through the

20
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,980
system and check that it hits all the points

21
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,790
that it needs to hit. One of

22
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,170
the targets is right here.

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,780
Spot on.

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,439
It's very important that from the star all

25
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,209
the way to the point inside the instrument

26
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:01,699
where we bring the light beams together that

27
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:04,499
the light travel time is exactly the same.

28
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:06,799
Now because the telescopes are at different

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,790
elevations and different parts of the mountain

30
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,698
and the Earth is constantly rotating,

31
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:12,969
these paths are forever changing.

32
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:15,120
So we have to continuously adjust

33
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,409
these paths within the instrument

34
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,400
using a thing called a delay line.

35
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,529
In interferometry, timing is everything and

36
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,690
that means that we have to get the light from

37
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,290
all six telescopes around the mountain

38
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,989
into this room at the same time.

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,459
While we can’t control the speed of light

40
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,709
or
the time it travels, what we can do is change

41
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,889
the path length over which it travels.

42
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,290
And that’s what this long tunnel is for.

43
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,608
These carts are optical trombones. Such

44
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:45,569
that we can add and subtract path-length

45
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:47,388
and make the light from each of the

46
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:49,650
six telescopes arrive at the same time

47
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,150
at the back end so that we collect

48
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,610
the data to make our pictures.

49
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,519
The ability to make images with

50
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,169
interferometry is dependant upon

51
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:01,989
how many telescopes

52
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,940
you can put into the mix.

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,780
As you add more and more telescopes, you

54
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:09,849
get to fill in more and more pieces of

55
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,220
this image that you're trying to

56
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,600
synthesize as if you had a big telescope.
